Inchoo_MaxOrderAmount
=====================

If you look at the Magento admin configuration area, you will see that Magento offers the opposite feature called Minimum Order Amount. You can find it under <strong>System > Configuration > Sales > Sales > Minimum Order Amount</strong>.

Minimum Order Amount functions slightly different than our Maximum Allowed Order Amount. The main difference is that with Maximum Allowed Order Amount you are not suppose to add anything new to the cart itself if it exceeds the maximum limit.
